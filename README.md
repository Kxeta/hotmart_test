# hotmart_test
This is a test for the oportunity to be a Front-end Developer at Hotmart

The files are inside the folder "TESTE_FINAL"

If you have downloaded this rep, you'll need to install some SW's:

 - RUBY
 - Ruby's gem COMPASS
 - Node.js
 - Grunt

After installed these sw's, you'll need to run three commands, inside the folder "TESTE_FINAL":

 - npm install
 - bower install
 - grunt

In case that everything fails, I've made a copy of the project. It is inside the folder "_emergency"

Any further questions, I'm available at caixeta.phillipe@gmail.com

Thanks!
